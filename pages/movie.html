                In a twilight world of international espionage, an unnamed CIA operative,
                known as The Protagonist, is recruited by a mysterious organization called
                Tenet to participate in a global assignment that unfolds beyond real time.
                The mission: prevent Andrei Sator, a renegade Russian oligarch with
                precognition abilities, from starting World War III. The Protagonist will
                soon master the art of "time inversion" as a way of countering the threat
                that is to come.

                It really confused me when I watched it yesterday. I can honestly say that
                I probably missed lots of details even though it came around in the end
                and settled nicely. I am sure that people who dive into the details will
                find these bits and pieces and time will help to digest the whole story.
                No matter you hate it or love it but you have to admit that the movies
                from Nolan are simply so innovative which the current movie industry
                simply cannot reproduce. He writes the story itself, he directs, chooses
                the actors, the locations and he mainly uses real world setups instead of
                computer generated ones. He is so creative and luckily does have the
                financial background to complete his plans. I think the main flaw of this
                movie that the viewer can feel unsatisfied at the end due to the complex
                setup and this brutal backwards mechanics.
